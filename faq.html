								<h3>What is Proofreading?</h3>
								<blockquote>Proofreading is about finding errors both small and large that were either missed or introduced during editing. Proofreaders ensure that the document's final draft is completely free of grammatical errors as well as formatting and typographical errors. They also make sure the document adheres to the chosen style guide. ProofHero's proofreading services will help you polish your writing and ensure it is ready for your readers.</blockquote>
								<h3>Can you save me time?</h3>
								<blockquote>ProofHero will not only make your work better but also save you time. Searching through your work time and again for hard-to-find errors and hidden issues is time consuming and taxing. It takes a lot of hours and energy, and there is still no guarantee of success, as it is easy to miss problems in your own work. As a writer, you sometimes see what you mean to say rather than what you are actually saying. ProofHero can correct these issues for you in a fraction of the time, and we can point out areas where further improvement is possible and offer suggestions about how to do this. And while ProofHero edits your document, you are free to do other things. Whether for work or play, your time is yours.</blockquote>
								<h3>How do I get a word count for my document?</h3>
								<blockquote>In Microsoft Word, go to the Review tab or Tools menu and select Word Count. If you're doing a word count for an academic paper, be sure to check the option to include footnotes and endnotes in the word count.</blockquote>
								<h3>What types of files do you accept? </h3>
								<blockquote>Currently, we accept most PC-compatible word-processing files, such as MS Word, WordPerfect, WordPad, Notepad, MS Works, Adobe Acrobat, MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, OpenOffice, Final Draft, LaTeX, and webpages. If you have Apple/Macintosh or Linux/Unix files, they can be saved and uploaded in a PC-compatible format (e.g., as a .doc, .docx, .txt, or .rtf).  If you are using a program not listed here, save your file as a text (.txt) file, a Rich Text file (.rtf), or as a last resort you can save it as a .pdf file.<br><br>We accept the following file extensions (the last part of your file name): csv, doc, docx, fdx, htm, html, odt, pdf, ppt, pptx, rtf, tex, txt, wpd, wps, xls, xlsx.</blockquote>
								<h3>How do I place an order with you?</h3>
								<blockquote>Placing an order with ProofHero is easy. On our <a href="index.html">Home</a> page, click at <a href="start.html">Get Started</a> and start by uploading your document. When you're ready to order, just click the Place Order button.</blockquote>
